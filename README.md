# multiple-viewcontrollers-objc

This example shows how to use DeepAR on multiple view controllers.

NOTE: DeepAR doesn't support using multiple view controllers in the SAME TIME. You can only have one ARView, but you can share it between multiple view controllers.

To run the example
* Go to https://developer.deepar.ai, sign up, create the project and the iOS app, copy the license key and paste it to ViewController.m (instead of your_license_key_goes_here string)
* Download the SDK from https://developer.deepar.ai and copy the DeepAR.framework into quickstart-ios-objc folder
